I used Kiva's open dataset to create a map colored by the number of loans by country. Overall, I found d3 to be very intuitive and easy to use. I still want to learn more about data binding (and how to scale choropleth colors correctly) as well as styling and CSS, but it was cool to get this from csv to map pretty painlessly. Looking forward to learning more. The d3 code is in index.html and the script used to prepare the dataset is in the iPython notebook. The final map: ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/rvsn5fq.png)
